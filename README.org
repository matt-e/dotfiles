* dotfiles

This is design to be a set of shared/public dotfiles. It lives as a submodule within a repo usually hosted within my current employer's VCS. This allows me to have a usually-shared set of default configurations, without leaking the details of my employer's environment. I don't keep secrets in my dotfiles or anything like that, but it's nice to keep a rigid separation between personal and professional environments.

** Setting up the super-environment

Add this repo as a submodule of the main dotfile repo, named 'public'. In the root of the main repo add an 'install.sh' script that has the following contents:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/bash

  # Add these directories because we don't want stow to manage the
  # entire ~/.emacs or ~/local paths
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/local/bin
  mkdir -p ${HOME}/.emacs.d

  stow -Rv -t $HOME public
  # Add additional lines for all other proprietary environments:
  # stow -Rv -t $HOME <employer>

#+END_SRC
